What is RuleChains? RuleChains provides a mechanism to wrap SQL and Services as business rules for aggregate processing without having to construct custom scripts (feeds). RuleChains is somewhat analogous to a pattern-based sequencer (a musician reference) for business rules. "Rules" are assembled into "Link" patterns and formed into "Chains" that can be triggered by a scheduling event or as an incoming REST event. A "chain" is actually just a sequence of "links". Each link contains a "rule" as well as it's execution properties and custom input/output handling (if needed).
